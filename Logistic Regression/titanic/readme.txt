Logistic Regression with Python

We will be working with the Titanic Data Set.
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
This is a very famous data set and will help us buil a simple logisitic regression model.

We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.
I have provided the "semi cleaned" dataset, you can use it if you don't want to download it from kaggle and perform some extra data cleaning.
